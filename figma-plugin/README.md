## Configuration

### Network Access

The plugin needs to communicate with your website builder. Update the `manifest.json` file to include your domain:

```json
{
  "networkAccess": {
    "allowedDomains": ["localhost:3000", "your-domain.com"]
  }
}
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Use `localhost:3000` for local testing
- **Production**: Replace with your actual domain

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Appearing
- Ensure all files are in the correct plugins directory
- Restart Figma after installation
- Check that `manifest.json` is valid JSON

### Export Fails
- Make sure you have selected at least one frame or component
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the website builder is running (for local development)
- Check browser console for error messages

### Design Elements Missing
- Ensure elements are properly named in Figma
- Use Figma's style system for better extraction
- Check that elements are not locked or hidden

## Development

### File Structure
```
figma-plugin/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json      # Plugin configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ code.js           # Main plugin logic

### Customization

You can customize the plugin by modifying:
